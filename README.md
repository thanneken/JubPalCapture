# JubPalCapture
Python tools for capturing multispectral image data from cultural heritage artifacts

This is a very early alpha. 
Documentation will be added after functionality is stabilized. 

JubPalCapture is intended to run on a [Multispectral Imaging Networked Capture Controller](https://palimpsest.stmarytx.edu/thanneken/2025/controller.html).
